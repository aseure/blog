Are you really reading this page? Ok, so you must be someone I know personnaly,
checking this blog for the first time. Otherwise, why bother?

I'm a happy software engineer working at [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/),
Paris. Check my [Github profile](https://github.com/aseure). I've worked a lot
with GCP technologies, Go, Scala to build near-real time analytics pipelines.

In my spare time, I'm learning piano and I'm also trying to take better
pictures than my phone and put them on
[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/124932626@N06/). I spend too much time
on YouTube and I really love to travel (already been to Canada, USA, Ireland,
England, Germany, Spain, Antilles) and I try to watch a play or go to a movie
theater when I'm not hanging in a bar with my friends.
