## Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Anthony, software engineer working at [Algolia](), Paris.

I've graduated from [EPITA](https://www.epita.fr), a French engineering school,
in 2015 (CSI'15). There, I learn about programming languages, data structures
and algorithms, computer vision and datascience, to name a few. I've also had
the opportunity to teach those same topics to younger students throughout the
years. Finally, I also had the chance to join the Research and Development
Laboratory of EPITA -- [LRDE](https://www.lrde.epita.fr/wiki/Home) -- where
I've worked on a research project around computer vision.

I've worked previously at [Arista Networks](https://www.arista.com) in San
Francisco for my end-of-studies internship.

I'm currently working at [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com) as a senior
software engineer. After working for nearly two years on the premises of our
analytics pipelines, I'm now part of a new team which is responsible for the
maintenance of the open-source backend API clients of Algolia.

I really like to learn about technical topics and I'm also teaching about the
ones I know (Go and programming languages in general, git, data structures and
algorithms).

I'm currently not looking for new full-time opportunities. However, if you are
linked to a school, university, bootcamp program, etc. I'd be really happy to
get back to teaching.
